            Love, Pets was founded in 2010 by passionate animal lovers, Mike and
            Ashley, who met while volunteering at a local animal shelter. After
            witnessing firsthand the joy that pets bring to people's lives, they
            decided to create a company that would help pet owners give their
            furry friends the best possible care. Today, Love, Pets is a
            thriving online community and store, dedicated to providing
            top-notch products, expert advice, and heartfelt support to pet
            owners everywhere.
